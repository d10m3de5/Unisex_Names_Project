# Are You Tired of Not Knowing If Your Name is Male or Female?
Then you have come to the right place. I mean, why trying to figure it out by yourself, when you can have someone else do it for you. Un1s3x Nam35 is a program built by Diomedes Suero, based on statistics by FiveThirtyEight. But, it is not only about boring stats, but also has an user interaction. The program shows a linear regression of the most common unisex names in America, ranking from 1-919. Thus, the program will use such statistics like mean, male share, standard deviation, female share, and gap between both males and female share, in order to determine the probability that your child's name is among the top 20 or even on the list. I mean, wouldn't you like to know? EXACTLY!, but before you look at my program make sure to look at the quick overview below. 
## Libraries Used By The Program 

### Pandas and Seaborn 
These two libraries were the ones I imported in order to work with my program. In order to import these libraries I used a common function called import and set different names for the libraries to be called as. Please take a look below for the different functions I used. 
## Functions 
I used functions such as .head(), .tail(), .describe(), to get a better review of the data. For example, unisex.head() will show a review of the top 5 most common unisex names in the list, while unisex.tail() will show the last 5 most common unisex names in the list. I also used other functions to build graphs, histograms, and show the correlation between the values in the list. 
## User Interaction
For the User Interaction, I built if and else functions to test if the name entered by the user was on the list or the top 20. If the name was found, then the program will output the statistics, and take a prediction about the gender of the child based on these statistics. 
## Conclusion
In conclusion, the program used basic functions that can be found in the imported libraries. After looking at the statistics, I found out that most males unisex names had a higher probability of being commonly used in America. As a result, if you have a child and most likely you want to choose an unisex name, then the most common one will be Riley. Please remember that this is just a program, and I don't choose your child's name to be male or female. I just analyze it! Thank you for using Un1s3x Nam35 program! :)
